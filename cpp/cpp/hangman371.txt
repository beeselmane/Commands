A change is as good as a rest
A drowning man will clutch at a straw
A fool and his money are soon parted
A friend in need is a friend indeed
A golden key can open any door
A good beginning makes a good ending
A good man is hard to find
A house is not a home
A leopard cannot change its spots
A little knowledge is a dangerous thing
A little of what you fancy does you good
A miss is as good as a mile
A miss is as good as a mile
A new broom sweeps clean
A penny saved is a penny earned
A picture paints a thousand words
A poor workman always blames his tools
A problem shared is a problem halved
A rising tide lifts all boats
A rolling stone gathers no moss
A soft answer turneth away wrath
A stitch in time saves nine
A thing of beauty is a joy forever
A trouble shared is a trouble halved
A volunteer is worth twenty pressed men
A watched pot never boils
A woman's work is never done
A word to the wise is enough
Absence makes the heart grow fonder
Absolute power corrupts absolutely
Accidents will happen.
Actions speak louder than words
Adversity makes strange bedfellows
All good things come to he who waits
All good things must come to an end
All is grist that comes to the mill
All roads lead to Rome
All that glisters is not gold
All the world loves a lover
All things come to those who wait
All things must pass
All you need is love
All's fair in love and war
All's well that ends well
An apple a day keeps the doctor away
An army marches on its stomach
An Englishman's home is his castle
Any port in a storm
Any publicity is good publicity
April showers bring forth May flowers
As you sow so shall you reap
Ask no questions and hear no lies
Attack is the best form of defence
Bad news travels fast
Barking dogs seldom bite
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder
Beauty is only skin deep
Beggars should not be choosers
Better late than never
Better safe than sorry
Beware of Greeks bearing gifts
Big fish eat little fish
Birds of a feather flock together
Blood is thicker than water
Boys will be boys
Brevity is the soul of wit
Business before pleasure
Caesar's wife must be above suspicion
Charity begins at home
Cheats never prosper
Children should be seen and not heard
Cleanliness is next to godliness
Clothes make the man
Cold hands, warm heart
Comparisons are odious
Count you blessings
Crime doesn't pay
Cut your coat to suit your cloth
Dead men tell no tales
Devil take the hindmost
Discretion is the better part of valour
Distance lends enchantment to the view
Do as I say, not as I do
Do as you would be done by
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
Don't burn your bridges behind you
Don't cast your pearls before swine
Don't change horses in midstream
Don't keep a dog and bark yourself
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Don't meet troubles half-way
Don't put all your eggs in one basket
Don't put new wine into old bottles
Don't put the cart before the horse
Don't rock the boat
Don't throw pearls to swine
Don't try to walk before you can crawl
Don't upset the apple-cart
Don't wash your dirty linen in public
East is east, and west is west
East, west, home's best
Easy come, easy go
Empty vessels make the most noise
Enough is as good as a feast
Enough is enough
Even a worm will turn
Every cloud has a silver lining
Every dog has his day
Every Jack has his Jill
Every little helps
Every man has his price
Every picture tells a story
Every stick has two ends
Everything comes to him who waits
Fact is stranger than fiction
Failing to plan is planning to fail
Faint heart never won fair lady
Fair exchange is no robbery
Faith will move mountains
Familiarity breeds contempt
Feed a cold and starve a fever
Fight fire with fire
Finders keepers, losers weepers
Fine words butter no parsnips
First come, first served
First impressions are the most lasting
First things first
Fish and guests smell after three days
Flattery will get you nowhere
Fools rush in where angels fear to tread
Forewarned is forearmed
Forgive and forget
Fortune favours the brave
Give a dog a bad name and hang him
Give credit where credit is due
God helps those who help themselves
Good fences make good neighbours
Good talk saves the food
Good things come to those who wait
Great minds think alike
Half a loaf is better than no bread
Handsome is as handsome does
Hard cases make bad law
Hard work never did anyone any harm
Haste makes waste
He who can does, he who cannot, teaches
He who hesitates is lost
He who laughs last laughs longest
He who pays the piper calls the tune
Hindsight is always twenty-twenty
History repeats itself
Home is where the heart is
Honesty is the best policy
Hope springs eternal
Horses for courses
If anything can go wrong, it will
If life deals you lemons, make lemonade
If the cap fits, wear it
If wishes were horses beggars would ride
If you can't be good, be careful
If you can't beat em, join em
If you pay peanuts, you get monkeys
Ignorance is bliss
In for a penny, in for a pound
In the midst of life we are in death
Into every life a little rain must fall
It goes without saying
It is best to be on the safe side
It is better to give than to receive
It is easy to be wise after the event
It never rains but it pours
It takes a thief to catch a thief
It takes all sorts to make a world
It takes one to know one
It takes two to tango
It's all grist to the mill
It's better to give than to receive
It's never too late
It's no use crying over spilt milk
It's the early bird that gets the worm
Jack of all trades, master of none
Judge not, that ye be not judged
Keep your chin up
Keep your powder dry
Laughter is the best medicine
Least said, soonest mended
Less is more
Let bygones be bygones
Let not the sun go down on your wrath
Let sleeping dogs lie
Let the buyer beware
Let the dead bury the dead
Let the punishment fit the crime
Let well alone
Life begins at forty
Life is just a bowl of cherries
Life is what you make it
Life's not all beer and skittles
Like father, like son
Little pitchers have big ears
Little strokes fell great oaks
Little things please little minds
Live for today for tomorrow never comes
Look before you leap
Love is blind
Love makes the world go round
Love thy neighbour as thy self
Love will find a way
Make hay while the sun shines
Make love not war
Man does not live by bread alone
Manners maketh man
Many a little makes a mickle
Many a mickle makes a muckle
Many a true word is spoken in jest
Many hands make light work
Marriages are made in heaven
Marry in haste, repent at leisure
Might is right
Mighty oaks from little acorns grow
Misery loves company
Moderation in all things
Money doesn't grow on trees
Money is the root of all evil
Money isn't everything
Money makes the world go round
Money talks
More haste, less speed
Nature abhors a vacuum
Necessity is the mother of invention
Needs must when the devil drives
Never give a sucker an even break
Never go to bed on an argument
Never judge a book by its cover
Never let the sun go down on your anger
Never look a gift horse in the mouth
Never speak ill of the dead
Never tell tales out of school
Nine tailors make a man
No man can serve two masters
No man is an island
No names, no pack-drill
No news is good news
No pain, no gain
No rest for the wicked
Nothing is certain but death and taxes
Nothing succeeds like success
Nothing venture, nothing gain
Oil and water don't mix
Once a thief, always a thief
Once bitten, twice shy
One good turn deserves another
One hand washes the other
One man's meat is another man's poison
One swallow does not make a summer
One volunteer is worth ten pressed men
Only fools and horses work
Out of sight, out of mind
Patience is a virtue
Pearls of wisdom
Penny wise and pound foolish
Physician, heal thyself
Possession is nine points of the law
Practice makes perfect
Practise what you preach
Prevention is better than cure
Pride goes before a fall
Procrastination is the thief of time
Put your best foot forward
Rain before seven, fine before eleven
Revenge is a dish best served cold
Revenge is sweet
Rob Peter to pay Paul
Rome wasn't built in a day
See no evil, hear no evil, speak no evil
Seeing is believing
Seek and ye shall find
Set a thief to catch a thief
Share and share alike
Shrouds have no pockets
Silence is golden
Slow but sure
Softly, softly, catchee monkey
Spare the rod and spoil the child
Speak as you find
Speak softly and carry a big stick
Still waters run deep
Strike while the iron is hot
Stupid is as stupid does
Talk is cheap
Tell the truth and shame the Devil
The age of miracles is past
The apple never falls far from the tree
The best defense is a good offense
The best things in life are free
The best-laid schemes of mice and men
The bottom line is the bottom line
The boy is father to the man
The child is the father of the man
The cobbler always wears the worst shoes
The customer is always right
The darkest hour is just before the dawn
The devil looks after his own
The early bird catches the worm
The end justifies the means
The exception which proves the rule
The good die young
The husband is always the last to know
The labourer is worthy of his hire
The leopard does not change his spots
The more the merrier
The pen is mightier than sword
The shoemaker's son always goes barefoot
The squeaking wheel gets the grease
The truth will out
There are two sides to every question
There but for the grace of God, go I
There's always more fish in the sea
There's an exception to every rule
There's honour among thieves
There's many a slip 'twixt cup and lip
There's more than one way to skin a cat
There's no accounting for tastes
There's no fool like an old fool
There's no place like home
There's no smoke without fire
There's no such thing as a free lunch
There's no such thing as bad publicity
There's no time like the present
There's one born every minute
There's safety in numbers
Third time lucky
Time and tide wait for no man
Time flies
Time is a great healer
Time is money
Time will tell
To err is human, to forgive divine
To the victor go the spoils
Tomorrow is another day
Tomorrow never comes
Too many cooks spoil the broth
Truth is stranger than fiction
Truth will out
Two heads are better then one
Two is company, but three's a crowd
Two wrongs don't make a right
Variety is the spice of life
Virtue is its own reward
Walls have ears
Waste not want not
What can't be cured must be endured
What goes up must come down
When in Rome, do as the Romans do
When the cat's away the mice will play
Where there's a will there's a way
Where there's muck there's brass
While there's life there's hope
Whom the Gods love die young
Why keep a dog and bark yourself?
Wonders will never cease
Worrying never did anyone any good
You are never too old to learn
You are what you eat
You can have too much of a good thing
You can't get blood out of a stone
You can't have your cake and eat it
You can't make bricks without straw
You can't teach an old dog new tricks
You can't win them all
Youth is wasted on the young
