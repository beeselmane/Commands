# Commands

This repository includes the source code for a bunch of commands that I've written over the years. I belive that the oldest files on here are from 3 years ago...

Some of these probably work, some of them probably don't, and some probably don't even make much sense.

I make no claims as to anything here. In fact, I'm just going to say that it's all public domain. That's right. Anything in this repository not otherwise covered by some license is as of now in the public domain. You're welcome.

Again, I didn't even read through most of these before uploading them, so I have no clue what you may find.
